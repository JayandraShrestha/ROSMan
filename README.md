# ROSMan
A new hydropower reservoir routine (ROSMan routine) into the SWAT modelwhich consists of two components: HydROR and ResSMan, was developed and integrated into SWAT. This routine enabled reservoir operation and sediment management of multiple reservoirs in a river basin scale through the ability to simulate flushing and sluicing for improved management of flows, energy production and sediment deposition.
